		<h3>Original Portfolio Above and Beyond</h3>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>
			I believe I did a few things that went above and beyond for
			this project. My most obvious one is that I think I have very
			clean, crisp, and professional looking CRAP design. Another
			area I went above and beyond with was the fact that I implemented
			CSS transistions. I created a lot of custom content for this site, 
			such as the graphs, as well as linking all of my social media accounts
			and my resume. Overall, I'm very pleased with how my portfolio came out 
			and am excited to see how I can improve it for the next project!

		<h3>Enhanced Portfolio Summary (For making grading easier)</h3>

			My main issues from project 2 were CSS validation errors, those have all
			been fixed.
			
			<br><br>
			
			My SPA, or DHTML, is located on my main portfolio page. Clicking on either thumbnail
			on the page will dynamically build the content that the thumbnail cooresponds to.
			
			<br><br>
			
			I am using several Javascript animations, the arrow buttons that close each section
			or point to the About Me section are all two seperate images that adjust opacity through
			Javascript. Each piece of content that dynamically builds will also fade in, and then when
			it is removed it will fade out.
			
			<br><br>
			
			There is a gallery on every project page (except Asteroids since I only have one image), 
			each gallery uses the FancyBox plugin and is activated by clicking on any of the images on
			the page.
			
			<br><br>
			
			All contact info is located in the About Me section
			
			<br><br>
			
			Both the Authorization page and the 404 error page can be accessed through links at the
			top of this page.

		<h3>Enhanced Portfolio Above and Beyond</h3>

		<p>
			For my above and beyond this project I used and implemented a plugin called smoothScroll.js to
			make my Javascript transistions look a lot nicer. I implemented a lot of both CSS and Javascript 
			transistions, including responsive resizing to make links "pop" a bit more as well as adjusting transparency
			through Javascript to change an image. I have links to all areas of the interwebs that employers may find
			me at. I still think my CRAP design pricipals are very well executed and I believe the incoorporation of 
			Javascript has only improved the overall aesthetic of my website. I also took the time to learn and implement FancyBox
			to make my galleries look a bit nicer. I also made my site responsive for many different screen sizes, not just 480px.
