		<h3>Role: Lead Designer and Programmer</h3>

		<p>
			This is a Unity3D project that I developed on my own for an Interactive
			 media development class. I am still improving it, with goals to replace the
			 current place-holder graphics with my own 3D models, as well as expanding this 
			 demo into a fully fledged game. In the full game the player will be able to control 
			 their legionnaires engage in battle with an artificial intelligence that controls
			 an opposing group.
			 
			 <br> <br>
			 
			 Long ago, the Roman Empire extended from the vast plains of Iberia to the far off
			 deserts of Parthia. Maintaining an empire this large required quite a bit of manpower.
			 Lately, the Roman Empire has found itself a bit strapped on legionnaire recruits so it
			 has resorted to using... er... Googly Eye Guys. They’re not the most ideal recruits but 
			 they’ll learn! Fitted out with standard Roman gear, Centurion Bob takes his recruits 
			 on their first real patrol through Roman occupied Transalpine Gaul. Bob expects it to 
			 be a simple training exercise for his newly formed cohort, after all, he’s only two 
			 weeks from retirement, what could possibly go wrong? Little do the recruits know, but 
			 they’re being watched...
			 
			 <br> <br>
			 
			 Flock implementation: The legionnaires flock together, as do the Barbarians. The 
			 Legionnaires don’t implement flocking in the traditional sense. Instead of seeking
			 a centroid, they seek their corresponding position on whichever rank their assigned to. 
			 The Celts (nothing more than filthy barbarians to the Romans), have no such concept of 
			 ranks. Therefore, they implement traditional flocking, where they seek the centroid. The
			 Celts version of flocking should look more familiar.
