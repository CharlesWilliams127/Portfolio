		<h3>C#</h3>
		
		<p>
			C# was the first language that I learned after coming to RIT.
			I easily consider it the language that I have the most knowledge
			in. I have made more applications than I can remember in C# (mostly
			small, but also some very large projects). In my free time, I use
			C# quite heavily to work on passion projects.
		</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3>C++</h3>
		
		<p>
			C++ is a language that I am currently learning and I have grown to really
			enjoy programming in it. While I am no expert, I am definitely feeling 
			comfortable with this language and am enjoying learning more about it.
			Currently I am working in C++ using OpenGL to implement a 3D game of
			billiards!
		</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3>JavaScript</h3>
		
		<p>
			JavaScript is another language I am currently learning. However, I have only just begun
			to interact with and use it. I am still very much a beginner when it comes to this
			language. However, I am constantly learning more about it and the more I learn
			the more I like!
		</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
		
		<p>
			For someone who wants to focus more on the back-end side of things, I actually really
			enjoy using HTML and CSS! This site you're on now was made entirely with these
			tools, and I enjoy building websites and interactive experiences with them.
			I have worked a lot with HTML and CSS and am quite proud of all I've 
			been able to accomplish with these tools.
		</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3>Python</h3>
		
		<p>
			Python is a language that I am currently re-teaching myself. I learned it
			once, in the long gone years of high school. Now, as I am pursuing a minor
			in software engineering, I am re-learing it to align myself more with that
			curriculum.
